I do need complete information's from complete comparison about COBOL code into @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt  file VS C# code into @src  directory C# code implementation, with statistics numbers about code comparisons and more relevant comparison information's, output have to be in HTML Format for a presentation.

Sources: CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt (single COBOL file) and all *.cs files under src/.

I do like additional metrics (e.g., per-namespace C# counts, COBOL section breakdown).

Rendered HTML file saved in the repo into Comparison/cobol-vs-csharp.html path).

I do like additional metrics and visuals (charts, per-namespace C# counts, COBOL section breakdown).

#IF HTML Charts become with ERROR
The charts are overlapping each other, fix this error.

I do want more slices (e.g., per-namespace class counts or COBOL PERFORM target list).

Include a section in HTML content complete information comparisons, charts, etc., about COBOL functionalities, business rules and tasks into  @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt file code VS C# codes into @src/  directory C# code implementation.

Add a TOTAL Percentage C# Code implementation covered into @src/  directory C# code implementation VS full COBOL Code into  @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt file code.

Include a section in HTML content complete information comparisons, charts, etc., about COBOL functionalities, business rules and tasks into  @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt file code VS NOT COVERED C# codes into @src/  directory C# code implementation.

Add a TOTAL Percentage C# Code implementation do NOT COVERED into @src/ directory C# code implementation VS full COBOL Code into  @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt file code.

Create a navigable menu content each section into menu.

Add a option to select Default Mode (current) or Dark Mode summary view.

Include a section content informations and statistics about "Mock" functionalities, classes, methods. tasks and etc., into @src/  directory C# Code Implementations, describe each "Mock" code found based COBOL Code into @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt 

Complete Mocks section informations and statics researching any reference or comments using "Mock", "Mockado", "Mocked", "Mocado" any related terms inside each one C# Code file (*.cs) into @src

Include a section in HTML content complete information and statistics about possibly NOT USED COBOL sections, functionalities, business rules or tasks into  @CobolCode/h1sf0033.txt.

Include a section in HTML content complete information and statistics about possibly duplicated C# services, functionalities, business rules or tasks into @src

Reorder HTML sections by related content proximity
