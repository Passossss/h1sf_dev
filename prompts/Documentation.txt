"You are an expert COBOL programmer and technical writer. Your task is to provide a complete and comprehensive documentation of the following COBOL program. The documentation should be suitable for both modern developers and business analysts who need to understand the system's logic and structure.
The output should cover the following sections:
Overview & Summary: A high-level description of the program's purpose, main function, and any immediate dependencies (e.g., databases, files, other programs).
Program Structure Analysis:
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION: Program ID, author, installation, and security (if applicable).
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION: Input-Output sections, file-control, and special names.
DATA DIVISION: A breakdown of WORKING-STORAGE SECTION variables with their PIC clauses, usage (e.g., COMP), values, and a brief explanation of their purpose. Include LINKAGE SECTION details if present.
PROCEDURE DIVISION: A detailed, step-by-step explanation of the logic flow, breaking down SECTIONS and PARAGRAPHS. Describe the sequence of operations and decisions.
Business Logic & Rules: Clearly state the core business rules and logic embedded within the code in plain, non-technical language.
Flowchart/Diagram (Textual or Mermaid): Generate a visual representation of the program control flow, either using text-based description or Mermaid syntax if the tool supports it.
Dependencies & Interfaces: List any external files, databases (DB2, CICS), copybooks, or sub-programs called, including their data mappings.
Code Comments (Inline): Provide the original COBOL code with generated, clear, and concise inline comments added throughout the program to explain key lines or blocks of logic.
Please ensure the documentation is structured, easy to read, and accurately reflects the provided COBOL source code in HTML format.

Create document header table with 1 line and 3 columns.
Header background color have to be something like Left side Dark Blue fade into Black in Right Side.
